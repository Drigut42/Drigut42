## Hello, I'm Drita Guta.

Currently focused on learning web development and excited to soon begin my career, 
I am eager to apply and grow my skills in a professional environment. 
With a strong interest in both frontend and backend development, 
Iâ€™m exploring various technologies and areas within web development before choosing a specialization.

I am actively involved in a full-stack project with a team of five, set to be completed by the end of September.

Thank you for your attention!

Iâ€™m open to connecting and discussing potential collaboration opportunities.
